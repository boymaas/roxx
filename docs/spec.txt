# Sox based renderer

Sox has file and effects. Every action on a file is an effect.

1. trimming  a file
2. setting a volume.

One has 2 ways of working with files:

1. merging the file
  * one cannot apply effects ..
  * one cannot trim ..
2. concatting the file
  * effects are possible ..
  * one can trim the output file ..

Only merging two audiofiles is not an effect.
