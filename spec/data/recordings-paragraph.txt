While you are inside this magical capsule, nothing ever changes...
because time simply stands still...
so you can actually move through time...
moving back, back through the years as though there were no such thing as time...
moving back to times past...
maybe even back to times before your own lifetime even began...
or perhaps moving forward through time...
to a time yet to come, yet to be...
